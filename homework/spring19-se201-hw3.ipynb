    "The **rank** of a matrix $A$ if the number of pivots in the reduced row echelon form of $A$. It is also the dimension of the column space $C(A)$, which is the dimension of the row space $R(A)$. The fact that the dimension of $C(A)$ and $R(A)$ are equal is very important, and it is not at all obvious. We will discuss more detail throughout this problem."

    "Let us show that $\\dim C(A) = \\dim R(A)$. Let $R$ be the reduced row echelon form of $A$ and $r$ be the number of pivots in $R$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us show that $r=\\dim C(A)$. Let $j_1,\\cdots,j_r$ be the columns of pivots. By problem 3-1, the set of column vectors $v_{j_1},\\cdots, v_{j_r}$ is linearly independent. Moreover, we show that any column vector $v_k$ of $A$ is written as linear combination of $v_{j_1},\\cdots, v_{j_r}$. If $v_k$ is one of $v_{j_1},\\cdots, v_{j_r}$, it is a linear combination of itself. If not, the set $v_k,v_{j_1},\\cdots,v_{j_r}$ is linearly dependent because the corresponding set $w_k,w_{j_1},\\cdots,w_{j_r}$ (column vectors in $R$) is linearly dependent. (The set $w_{j_1},\\cdots,w_{j_r}$ forms a canonical basis of $C(W)$.) By problem 3-1, the set $v_k,v_{j_1},\\cdots,v_{j_r}$ is also linearly dependent. That is, there are coefficients $c_k,c_{j_1},\\cdots,c_{j_r}$, which are not all zero, satisfying \n",
    "    $$c_kv_k + c_{j_1}v_{j_1} + \\cdots + c_{j_r}v_{j_r} = 0.$$\n",
    "Here, $c_k\\neq0$ because $v_{j_1},\\cdots, v_{j_r}$ is linearly independent. Thus $v_k$ can be written as linear combination of $v_{j_1},\\cdots, v_{j_r}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By problem 3-2, we know that $r=\\dim R(A)$. Thus we can conclude that $\\dim C(A) = \\dim R(A)$.\n",

    "### Remark\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, the **rank** plays crucial role in determine whether the matrix is nonsingular. If a $n\\times n$ matrix $A$ has rank less than $n$, then $A$ is singular, that is $A$ has no inverse. If the matrix $A$ is of rank $n$, in other words *full rank*, then $A$ has its inverse. Moreover, a full rank matrix has nonzero determinant, and vice versa."
